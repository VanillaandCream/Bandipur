# Bandipur Kannada + Latin Fonts

Bandipur is an original Kannada and Latin display typeface. 
It began as a beautiful display Latin in a single weight by John Vargas Beltran, and then Pria Ravichandran extended it to the Kannada script.
In the Kannada, the Ottu characters are aligned in a single line to be consistent with the Latin, which has very little variation in the x-height. 
This gives the design a strong presence.

Thank you to Vaishnavi Murthy for feedback on the Kannada during development.

The Bandipur project is led by Pria Ravichandran, a type designer from India.
