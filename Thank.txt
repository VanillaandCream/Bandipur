Bandipur is a Unicode-compliant Kannada and Latin display typeface. It is a collaborative effort between designers John Vargas Beltr√°n and Pria Ravichandran. As the design is reminiscent of a feral nature, Bandipur is named after the dry deciduous forest located in the state of Karnataka. 

Many thanks to Vaishnavi Murthy for her extensive feedback on this typeface.
